Hook object destructor to clean up the dirty flag entry
Hook get_property_p to handle cases where property zval is modified directly
Hook write_dimension?
Handle more error cases nicely
Write uninstrument_object func?
Add logic in instrument_object to determine if the object can be safely instrumented, or if it has embedded objects that may change without setting the dirty flag
Much moar tests
